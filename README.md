# Naval_Battle
Here is the repository of a command line Naval Battle game. ðŸš¢ðŸš¢  

This project, made in my first year of engineering study at ESEO, led us to practice Object Oriented Programming in Python.

To run the game, just run the main.py file by typing in your terminal : python3 main.py
